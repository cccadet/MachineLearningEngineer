Then we use the model to classify the new clients based on their feasures(spending on each category). The target variable will be the index of the cluster group (0 or 1 in this probelm.)\n",

    "Another way I can come up with is that, we compute the distance between the features of the new clients to the centers of each cluters and then pick up the closest cluster as the classification of the new client. Or in the GMM model, we only perform these E-steps for the new data points to include them into the clustering. \n",

    "*How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?*"

    "There are customer segments that would be purely classified as \"Retailers\" or \"Hotels/\"Restaurants/Cafes\" on the extreme left and right accordingly. However most data points though are somewhat ambiguous and do not clearly belong to one cluster or the other. There is considerable overlap in the true distribution.\n",
